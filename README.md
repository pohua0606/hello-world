# hello-world
This is the first time using Github 
This is my first time using the Github, actually, i have never thought that i would be like a computer worker before.
So, i'm honsetly some nervous about this, for choosing a route that you aren't familiar with is totally not easy.
However, i believe i can make it, and no wrong way!
